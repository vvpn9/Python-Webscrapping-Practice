The whole project is based on the Marco Bonzanini's blog

The purpose of imitation and extension is to practice python and data mining skills
such as R and SQL ï¼ˆmaybe later on after I finished the python part)

The whole process will contain sevens steps which are listed as following:
1. Collecting the Data
2. Text Processing
3. Term Frequencies
4. Rugby and Term Co-Occurrences
5. Data Visualisation Basics
6. Sentiment Analysis Basics
7. Geolocation and Interactive Maps

Maybe I will try to data mine the chinese version of twitter later on after
I know the basic steps to take the job

For R part, the use of ggplot to plot Frequency vs. Timeline, etc.

For SQL part, maybe the use of MySQL and some other database management software/system (habase)
